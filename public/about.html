<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, thanks for checking out my page! My name is Durim Bardhi, I'm a 25 year old
  web developer from Tallahassee, Florida. I graduated from Florida State University
with a bachelor's degree in I.C.T. (Information,communication, & Technology)
  </p>

<p>During my sophmore year of college I started to work at one of my family's restaraunts 
  and quickly fell in love with customer service and serving some of the best Italian food
in Tallahassee. Post graduation, it made the most sense for me to start working full time 
to help my family continue to grow our 30 year old business.  </p>

<p>Now that time has passed, I've realized that I want to take a step back from the restaurant 
  industry and pursue a tech related career. I have recently started taking a web development 
  class online to brush up on some previous skills and to find out exactly what career i 
  want to pursue. I will be posting my progress on this site.
